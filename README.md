*Learn how to use Node.js environment to configure and run your JavaScript automation testing scripts on the [LambdaTest Selenium cloud platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=nodejs-selenium-sample).*

* [Executing The Test](#executing-the-test)
* [Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects](#testing-locally-hosted-or-privately-hosted-projects)

## Pre-requisites

Before getting started with Selenium automation testing on LambdaTest, you need to:

* Download and install **NodeJS**. You should be having **NodeJS v6 to NodeJS v16**. Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download.
* Make sure you are using the latest version of **JavaScript**.
* Install **npm** from the official website by clicking [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).
* Download [Selenium JavaScript bindings](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) from the official website. Latest versions of **Selenium Client** and **WebDriver** are ideal for running your JavaScript automation testing script on LambdaTest’s Selenium Grid.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies and tutorial repo

Clone the LambdaTest’s [nodejs-selenium-sample](https://github.com/LambdaTest/nodejs-selenium-sample) repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/nodejs-selenium-sample
cd nodejs-selenium-sample
```
You need to install the following dependencies to your `package.json` file: 

You will need to install the `selenium webdriver` to make the connection to the `GRID`: 

```bash
npm install selenium-webdriver
```

Create a new file as `index.js` in your current project or the sample folder and add the below code snippet which will call the installed driver. 

```js
// index.js
const webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');
```

### Setting up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=nodejs-selenium-sample) or through [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=nodejs-selenium-sample).

Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

  * For **Linux/macOS**:
  ```bash
  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```
  * For **Windows**:
  ```bash
  set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```

### Connecting to The Cloud Grid

Now you can add the `GRID HOST` which is used to connect your current test suites to be executed on the cloud grid. 

```js
// index.js
// username: Username can be found at automation dashboard
const username = process.env.LT_USERNAME;

// AccessKey:  AccessKey can be generated from automation dashboard or profile section
const accessKey = process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY;

const gridUrl = 'https://' + username + ':' + accessKey + '@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub';

    // Setup and build selenium driver object
    const driver = new webdriver.Builder()
        .usingServer(gridUrl)
        .withCapabilities(capabilities)
        .build();

```
The above grid connect will create the `Webdriver` for the test suite to execute the `Selenium` commands for your test. 

## Run Your First Test

### Configuration of Your Test Capabilities

In the test script, you need to update your test capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:

```js
// index.js
// Setup capabilities, Know more about LamdbdaTest Capabilities: https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/
    const capabilities = {
        "browserName": "Chrome",
        // "browserVersion": "latest", #Uncomment to Specify Browser Version 
        "LT:Options": {
            name: 'NodeJS Get Set Go', // name of the test
            build: 'NodeJS Loves LambdaTest', // name of the build
            "project": "Build-With-LambdaTtest",
            "w3c": true,
            "plugin": "NodeJS",
            "customData": {
                "buildNumber": "1234",
                "environment": "Staging",
                "apiVersion": "v1.2.3",
                "releaseTag": "v1.2.3-rc1"
            },

        }
```
> **Note:** You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=nodejs-selenium-sample)**.

### Writing your Test Cases

Now you write your selenium test cases in your `index.js` file:

```js
async function todoTest() {
   try {
        // Navigate to a URL, click on the first and second list items and add a new one in the list.
        await driver.get('https://lambdatest.github.io/sample-todo-app/');
        await driver.findElement(webdriver.By.name('li1')).click();
        console.log("Successfully clicked first list item.");
        await driver.findElement(webdriver.By.name('li2')).click();
        console.log("Successfully clicked second list item.");

        await driver.findElement(webdriver.By.id('sampletodotext')).sendKeys('Complete Lambdatest Tutorial\n');
        await driver.findElement(webdriver.By.id('addbutton')).click();
        console.log("Successfully added a new task.");
        await driver.executeScript('lambda-status=passed');
    } catch (err) {
        console.log("test failed with reason " + err);
        await driver.executeScript('lambda-status=failed');
    } finally {
        await driver.quit();
    }
}

todoTest();
```

## Executing the Test

Please execute the following command below to run your tests: 

```bash
npm test OR node index.js
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [LambdaTest automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=nodejs-selenium-sample). LambdaTest Automation Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [LambdaTest Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=nodejs-selenium-sample) using LambdaTest Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using LambdaTest Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

>Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

Here’s how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

>Download the binary file of:
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```js
const capabilities = {
        tunnel: true,
}
```
